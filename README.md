**How I built this website**

My name is Mikhail. I decided to build this website as a project for my SEI course at General Assembly. As a car enthusiast, I'm interested in different types of motor veicles and especially in cars. This website is good resource, to see what people say about their cars and what people think about other people's cars. I used [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize and plan the scope of work. To make a diagram for models, I used [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) was my go to website for wireframes.

To build this website I've used:

What I've learned after I built this website:

* Console log and test everything, before and after building functionality
* Ask people for help when problem takes a lot of time to fix
* Take brakes to stay productive
* Follow 5 steps when building RESTful routes
* There are few ways to get a desired result, so I choose the one with less possible bugs

My future plans for this project:

* Add pages to view a list of popular brands, colors, which cars are for sale and 5 newest - oldest cars.
* Add option to show gallery of user's pictures for any car

This website was built in March 2022.
